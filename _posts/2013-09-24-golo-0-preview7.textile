We are quite busy with a new academic year and the avalanche of emergencies that we have to deal with, but we still found a bit of time to craft you a new preview of Golo.

* "Try Golo on Google AppEngine":http://golo-console.appspot.com/
* "Download a preview release of Golo":/download/
* "Read the Golo programming language guide":/documentation/next/
* "Fork the project on GitHub":https://github.com/golo-lang/golo-lang
* "Get in touch on our mailing-list":http://groups.google.com/group/golo-lang

h3. It's mostly about fixes, really

This release is mainly about fixing bugs, mainly:

* @golo run@ launching programs twice,
* closure recursive calls,
* handling of @"@ in templates,
* relaxing parser rules on blanklines in case and match (by Daniel).

There are also some new minor features:

* augmentations in strings to convert to numbers (by Philippe),
* improvements to the benchmarks suite.

h3. Golo at PPPJ 2013

We presented Golo at the "PPPJ 2013 research conference.":http://pppj2013.dhbw.de/conference-pppj2013.html

We received encouraging feedback on Golo following our paper and presentation. Speaking about the paper, you can "download it!":http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2500828.2500844

h3. That's all, folks!

Remember that you don't need a PhD to help Golo, so do not hesitate to get in touch with us!

In most cases you help us *a lot* just by reporting weird compilation or behavior in simple code snippets that you wrote...
