title: 'Viral marketing thanks to Ninja Squad'
---

We would like to take a moment to thank the [awesome team at Ninja Squad](http://ninja-squad.com/) for helping the Golo project. Ninja Squad offered us a bunch of nice stickers that we will be able to distribute at events to promote Golo.

We started distributing some last week at the [Mix-IT conference](http://www.mix-it.fr/) which was a huge success in Lyon, France, gathering an impressive list of speakers.

You can see the Golo sticker used for viral marketing on some of the speakers laptops:

### No strings attached

It has to be said that [Ninja Squad](http://ninja-squad.com/) did this with absolutely no condition. We do not have to make any promotion of their activity, but because [they are a small team of passionate people](http://ninja-squad.com/team) with [similar values as ours](http://ninja-squad.com/work), we will do anyway.

**If you are looking for a small shop of developers, trainers and consultants who know what they are doing, talk to Ninja Squad.**

They are based in France, but they can work from pretty much everywhere, too!

Thanks again Agnès, Cédric, Cyril and Jean-Baptiste!
