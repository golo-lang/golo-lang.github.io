title: "Now available: Eclipse Golo 3.4.0"
---

We know, it's been a _very_ long time since we last had a release, but today we are happy to offer Golo 3.4.0!

This release is here thanks to the contributions of Yannick Loiseau and Philippe Charri√®re.

### How to get Golo 3.4.0

You can get a [Golo 3.4.0 distribution from the corresponding GitHub release](https://github.com/eclipse/golo-lang/releases/tag/release%2F3.4.0).

You may also get artifacts from Maven Central.

### A note about Java versions

Golo 3.4.0 has been validated on Java 8.

It will mostly work with reflective access warnings of Java strong encapsulation with Java 11+, but it will not run with Java 17 unless you manually "open" modules.
