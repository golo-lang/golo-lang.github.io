...and here comes a new Golo preview!

h3. (for the impatient)

Here is what's new in Golo @0-preview6@.

# New collection literals for common data structures (arrays, tuples, lists, sets, maps, vectors).
# The ability to define stuctured data types through the @struct@ keyword.
# Number literals now support underscores (contributed by Franck Verrot).
# Dynamic objects performance is better than ever (@~14x@ factor).

h3. Collection literals

You can now take advantage of collection literals, as summarized in the following table:

|_. Collection |_. Java type |_. Syntax |
| Tuple | @gololang.Tuple@ | @tuple[1, 2, 3]@, or simply @[1, 2, 3]@ |
| Array | @java.lang.Object[]@ | @array[1, 2, 3]@ |
| List | @java.util.LinkedList@ | @list[1, 2, 3]@ |
| Vector | @java.util.ArrayList@ | @vector[1, 2, 3]@ |
| Set | @java.util.LinkedHashSet@ | @set[1, 2, 3]@ |
| Map | @java.util.LinkedHashMap@ | @map[[1, "a"], [2, "b"]]@ |

p. 

Here is a sample usage:

{% highlight text %}
let data = map[
  ["foo", "bar"],
  ["plop", set[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]],
  ["mrbean", map[
    ["name", "Mr Bean"],
    ["email", "bean@outlook.com"]
  ]]
]
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Structs

Structs are great if you need to define data types:

{% highlight text %}
module sample

struct Person = { name, age, email }

function main = |args| {
  let p1 = Person("Mr Bean", 54, "bean@gmail.com")
  println(p1: name())
  let p2 = Person(): name("John"): age(32): email("john@b-root.com")
  println(p2: age())
}
{% endhighlight %}

Structs come with many goodies, including proper @toString()@, @equals()@ and @hashCode()@ implementations. They are iterable, and immutable copies can be made.

Because structs translate to real JVM classes, you may also take advantage of _augmentations_ to add behavior, as the following example shows:

{% highlight text %}
module StructDemo

struct Point = { x, y }

augment StructDemo.types.Point {

  function move = |this, offsetX, offsetY| {
    this: x(this: x() + offsetX)
    this: y(this: y() + offsetY)
    return this
  }
}

function main = |args| {
  let p = Point(1, 1)
  println(p)
  p: move(10, 5)
  println(p)
}
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Dynamic object performance

The runtime method dispatch logic for dynamic objects has been rewritten. The new @invokedynamic@-based plumbing results in a simpler code with less call site invalidations.

This results in dramatically faster dynamic objects!

h3. In the community

Our small and fun community is active!

h4. Eclipse support

Jeff Maury is making strong progress with the Golo Eclipse tooling, ensuring that it stays current with the additions in the Golo grammar.

h4. AppEngine-based console

Philippe Charrière contributed a few improvements to our demonstration web console that runs on Google AppEngine.

He changed the editor component, providing syntax highlighting. He also included the proper metadata so that the page can be saved as an application on iOS devices. You have no more excuses for not trying Golo while in the bus.

h4. Wanna work on our NetBeans IDE?

The NetBeans support for Golo is currently behind the language evolutions, so if you are interested in helping out this is a very solid bet!
